title: MKR Distribution and the MKR Fund
---


## MKR distribution

The total MKR supply begins at 1,000,000 MKR when Maker is first deployed. Slightly less than 450,000 MKR (45%) was distributed to founders and early investors in the system before deployment in a combination of founders stake, private and public sales.

The remaining undistributed 550,000 MKR is held by the MKR Fund, which is the entity that controls money on behalf of the Maker DAO.

## The MKR Fund

The MKR Fund can be seen as the "wallet component" of Maker, and is controlled alongside the rest of the system using the same governance mechanisms (voting with MKR, using the governance meeting as the platform where voters organize). Members of the community can request money from the fund, and it is then up to MKR holders to vote on whether or not fulfilling a request with money from the fund will be overall profitable for the DAO.

As the MKR Fund is ultimately controlled by holders of the MKR asset through voting, the implicit goal of the fund is to maximize the long term value of MKR by investing in projects and developments that generate a positive return for the overall MKR market cap.

The most important way in which the Fund pursues this goal is to pay salaries (to individuals) and recurring payments (to companies) and other expenses of Maker during the early development of the system, and prepare a strategy for covering long term expenses in a sustainable manner once the system is fully developed and its blockchain infrastructure is locked down.
