#Introduction to Maker

##Bitcoin and blockchain technology

Blockchain technology first began with Bitcoin, a cryptographically secured, decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin's unique properties gave it a number of advantages that made it extremely useful for some types of international and internet-based transactions. However, its experimental nature has led to a number of issues including high price volatility, and high cash burn for its proof-of-work based security mechanism.

The second generation of blockchains, spearheaded by the Ethereum project, has focused on unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology by acting as a platform for creating and enforcing **Smart Contracts** - software objects that are able to own and control real assets and enforce their own rules, removing the need for traditional legal services.

Smart contracts enable a wide range of new use cases for blockchain technology. One such use case is the **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** - an economic organization whose assets, rules, and structure are coded into and managed entirely by smart contracts. As with smart contracts themselves, the properties of the DAO allow it to exist without the need for a traditional legal system to enforce its rules. It also provides strong resistance against censorship or external control of the organization by other entities than those who are designated as owners in the rules of the DAO.

In addition to DAOs and many other completely new use cases, smart contracts also greatly enhance the capabilities of cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin and other first generation cryptocurrencies. Smart contracts enable complex behaviour, such as autonomous monetary policy that counteracts volatility, and decentralized insurance.

##Introducing Maker

Maker is a DAO based on the Ethereum blockchain, where it maintains the infrastructure for the Dai - a cryptocurrency that uses smart contract enforced monetary policy to create price stability.

The Dai enables Ethereum users to transact with other smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain without having to deal with the volatility that is associated with traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It also functions as a decentralized savings account as it is long term deflationary, resulting in slow and steady capital gains.

Maker is able to maintain the price stability of the Dai through the Dai Credit System, which backs the Dai with collateral stored in Ethereum smart contracts, while simultaneously functioning as an internet-based, p2p credit market that commoditizes credit by allowing anyone with collateral that can be tracked on Ethereum to take out loans with low transaction costs and no middle man fees.

The Maker DAO is owned by the people who bought its core token (called MKR) during the development of the system. This token is also a cryptocurrency like the Dai, but does not have price stability and is highly speculative and volatile. Its function is to provide deposit insurance to the users of the Dai, as well as regulate the risk of the Dai Credit System as a whole. Maker doesn't have a legal entity or any representation in the legal world, as the entirety of the organizations business logic is fully automated and executed on the Ethereum Blockchain.

##The three types of users of the Dai Credit System

**Dai issuers use the Dai** to borrow money instantly and without any requirements beyond posting adequate collateral. There are no term limits, and debt positions can opened and covered at any time. This means the Dai can service most types of credit demand, including margin trading and business credit.

**Dai holders use the Dai** as a stable cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, and as a low risk investment and savings asset that is free from volatility risk and is long term deflationary. The Dai has low risk relative to most blockchain assets because every Dai is provably backed by a diversified pool of collateral on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as by Makers insurance.

**MKR owners gain value from the Dai** because MKR represents the ownership of Makers insurance service. Dai issuers pay an insurance fee on the Dai which is funneled to the owners of MKR. In return Maker is forced to bail out bad debt in the event of a sudden collateral crash (a so-called black swan event). If Maker does not have enough assets on hand to immediately cover all bad debt, the MKR supply is automatically inflated and sold off to raise funds in order to cover all the bad debt over time. As a result, MKR owners are exposed to both the profits and the risk of Makers insurance service.
